or

##### blank & tab & newline #####

	cecho -r -t hello -B world -n !

##### set fg to red, bg to yellow, action to highlight and underline: #####

	cecho -r -by -hl "hello world !"

##### set ( red, yellow, highlight & underline ) for "hello", ( cyan, red, reverse ) for "world", ( green, black, blink ) for "!" : #####

	cecho -r -by -hl -ul hello -d -B -c -br -re world -d -B -g -bl !

`cecho -h`

## Advanced ##

- Action flag `-d` ( same as `-done` ) will **turn off all settings** ( fg, bg and action ), In **one** command, you have to set flags again once there are other strings after `-d`.
- It's **not** necessary use `-d` at the end of command, cecho do it automatically.
- Some special characters ( with centain format ) don't work well, such as `cecho "!"`. It's due to `echo` . use `cecho '!'` or `cecho !` instead.
- Some actions can overlaied, some can't.

## Thanks ##

Thanks to [https://github.com/jonhiggs/cecho](https://github.com/jonhiggs/cecho), when I completed the script and try uploading it to github I found this -- with same name and almost same function ... and then, I got the way to build table in README.md from there.
